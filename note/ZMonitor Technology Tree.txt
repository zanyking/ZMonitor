ZMonitor Technology Tree:



System Execution Monitoring : 
	|	[DONE]Extracting Monitor Sequence from call sequence through Native API.
	|
	|-> Console view of Monitor Sequence:
	|		[DONE] To help developer getting better understanding to an excution's call sequence.
	|		[ N/A] provide template mechanism for Console Handler
	|
	|-> adaptation to Logging System
	|		|
	|		|-> Leverage exsiting Logging system (Log4j, Slf4j, logback):
	|				[DONE] To extract Monitor Sequence from call sequence by leveraging slf4j.
	|					[DONE] Slf4j logger log impl.(get a quick & direty version)
	|					[DONE] Slf4j Configurator (for slf4j tracker) in zmonitor.xml
	|					[DONE] Slf4j tracker Interface(identify needed factors)
	|				[ N/A] To extract Monitor Sequence from call sequence by leveraging log4j.
	|				[ N/A] To extract Monitor Sequence from call sequence by leveraging Lobgback.
	|				[ N/A] provide push, pop, record control through message pattern.
	|					[N/A] extract the machenism form Slf4j impl as a general solution.
	|
	|-> combind with JUnit
	|		|
	|		|-> ZMonitor Implementation for Self Unit Testing
	|		|		[DONE] a JUnit test suite for ZMonitor Configuration test.
	|		|		[DONE] a JUnit test suite for ZMonitor Selection API test.
	|		|
	|		|-> Legacy System for Business Object Unit Testing: 
	|				DESC: Achieve good testing coverage to a high-level Object without refactoring.
	|				[DONE] same as the internal testing.
	|
	|-> combind with JUnit, JMeter
	|		|
	|		|-> Web Application Testing: 
	|				DESC: In a ZMonitorWebTestCase, developer can shoot a URL through JMeter to trigger a specific execution of the web application. 
	|				Then, the ZMonitorWebTestCase will get back the Monitor Sequence which reflects such execution, 
	|				and developer now has the ability to check the validity of it through manipulating the Monitor 
	|				Sequence, by using a sophisticated ZMonitor Selection API.
					[ N/A] Integrate JMeter into 
	|				[ N/A] A WebTestBase.java for developer to extend.
	|				[ N/A] WebTestBase should provide utility API for developer to 
	|
	|-> IDE Integration
	|		|
	|		|->  Active Web App Monitoring: through Request.
	|				Active System Assertion through unit test case. (Has possibility to reuse the TestCase)
	|				[ N/A] WebAppAssertion 
	|				[ N/A] IDE MS Handler, send MS to IDE side
	|				[ N/A] Eclipse Plugin which receive MS as an event, provide an interactive interface for Developer to Browse, Query and Delete Monitored Sequences.
	|					[ N/A] jq Selector mixed with other syntaxes for management and special condition.
	|					[ N/A] delete
